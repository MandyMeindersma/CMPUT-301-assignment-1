My app is designed using a navigation bar and a floating action button. You can see all the habits on the main page,
add habits on the main page, see the history (from nav bar) of a total number of habits you have made (including deleted 
habits), delete all information (from nav bar) and while viewing on habits you can see their functions and/or
delete them.

To view habits: short click them
To delete habits: long click them and then click to delete for sure

Once you have clicked on a habit:
To complete: click start button
To delete a completion: long click a date in the list and confirm to delete
